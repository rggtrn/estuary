Webdirt glitch with accelerate of '2' - '1'

Problem was: 
	Initializing new widgets with 'liveness' consistent with what everything else was. 
	Fixes I thought of:
		Every time a new object is added to the container, send another event to all children to change their liveness
		to what it was

		What I went with - have dynamic value constantly reporting the liveness - all new objects just use that value



func::(a -> Event t b -> Dynamic t (a, Event t b) -> (Dynamic Context -> a -> Event t b -> Dynamic t (a,Event t b))
func b= (\x-> b)
